This is a project to play Tic Tac Toe game

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

In order to run the game we need to enter to the folder from the console and then run the command `./bin/tic_tac_toe.rb`
